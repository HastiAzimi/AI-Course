Sitting here watching on my 13 mini with 71% battery health waiting patiently for my self gifted Christmas gift (iPhone 17)  I’ll still be running this 13 mini to the ground with YouTube playing at night. It just won’t be my “daily” anymore in the same sense.,2025-12-24
I have the iPhone 16E with no complaints,2025-12-24
"The best base iPhone Apple has ever released. It was about damn time they added a ProMotion display. Apple also giving the iPhone 17 Pro upgrades like the improved selfie camera, upgraded main cameras to 48MP on both lenses, an anti-reflective coating, and starting at 256GB for the same price as the iPhone 16 last year makes this phone absolutely incredible. The colors are great as well. I have the Sage color, and it looks really good. I upgraded from the 14 Pro and I’m glad I did, especially because I saved so much money thanks to how good the base version is",2025-12-24
"2:00 I’m using an iPhone 13 Pro Max rn, my battery life capacity is at 70%. I need to get it serviced but I’m prolly just gonna upgrade anyways since this phone is fully paid off but it’s my first iPhone so I don’t have the desire to trade it in.",2025-12-24
Great and informative review ! Thanks,2025-12-24
really helped me; i have a 12 Pro (very similar to the 13) and want to upgrade. thanks a lot!,2025-12-24
"Coming from a 13 mini to this 17. A great improvement under every aspect although I miss the lightness of the mini. Never had issues with memory since my 13 mini had 512gb and this 17 too. I would have loved a 768gb or 1 tb option but it’s ok. No point in buying the Pro, this standard 17 is incredible",2025-12-24
"Yep I have the 13 Mini!, 256GB. You are incorrect about 17 vs 17 pro sales, 17 pro huge",2025-12-24
I NEVER SEE PEOPLE COMING FROM PRO MAX TO JUST A PRO,2025-12-24

I hadn't seen a video from you in over a year and this popped up,2025-12-24
"In may this year I got a used iPhone 15 and ditched my iPhone 12 mini (that I also had gotten used), but the orange 17 pro is the first iPhone I really really wanted, and I wanted it new so it became my first ever new iphone, so funny when it seems this is the time everyone else is skipping the pro",2025-12-24
"Im using a Samsung a15  its horrible and the screen is half broken, if i was to upgrade id def go for the 17 base model it looks very clean.",2025-12-24

Why did you get the black iPhone 17 when you had a white iPhone 13?,2025-12-24

"The amount of hype round this phone has meant there haven’t been any discounts on this base model this season , 16 base last year had plenty of discounts last year by this point",2025-12-24
"Good summary. 13 mini user here. I'm still happy, or at least I was until Apple forced iOS 26 on me. We'll see how that goes. I charge it on a magsafe stand overnight or magsafe in the car, so 15W / lightning really aren't a huge deal, it lasts me well enough. I use an iPad for a lot of things, so the phone doesn't get used a ton, certainly not doom scrolling. I have a small magsafe battery from baseus which can fully charge it in a pinch, and that's in my bag just in case, but I've only needed it once. I really don't care about Apple Intelligence today, maybe if that gets better, but I'm not holding my breath. I'd like better cameras, and a better display wouldn't hurt. Useful Siri would probably clinch the deal. But I love the mini form factor, I'm really not looking forward to carrying a bigger/heavier phone. My next iPhone will likely be the 17, the improvements over the 16 are compelling.",2025-12-24
From 11 pro to 17 and I already love it,2025-12-24
"I switched to 17 from 12 ProMax , no regrets.",2025-12-24
wild that the iphone 13 is what you’re comparing it to. It’s a bit laggy now and lowkey stressful for everyday use. I think it’s upgrade time.,2025-12-24
I get hacked and stalked like insane on my original IPhone which was bought in Austria. It is a 2022 Iphone SE.,2025-12-24
jailbreak to use apps for free? no thanks i stay with android,2025-12-24
"I was locked for base 17 but now I’m seeing comparison videos of 17 zoomed photos and 17 Pro zoomed photos and that telephoto camera really makes a difference. Also night time photos look better on Pro. I like taking pictures when I’m travelling or few videos when I’m at concert and I tend to use zoom way more than ultrawide. For the reference I have base 11 and I still think those cameras hold up but zoom and night time photos just suck. Slightly bigger battery, vapor chamber and slightly better processor is good as well but basically I only need telephoto camera from Pro but is it worth it extra 300.. need to decide until next weekend when imma go buy either 17 or 17 Pro.",2025-12-24
Comparing 13 to a 17 bro? Waste of my time,2025-12-24
Traded in my 13 Pro Max and got $320 off a 512GB iPhone 17. Very happy with it.,2025-12-24
iPhone 8 Plus with 64GB️ did order a 17 though,2025-12-24

3 months is NOT long term,2025-12-24
Just got the 17 from the 13.  The 120hz refresh rate on the base model really sold me,2025-12-24
Every 2/3 years is a good sweet spot for updating. It’s really every 3 generations. So 14 to 17 is a huge jump. I’m gonna upgrade to 17 pro soon. I’m on 14 pro.,2025-12-24
I upgraded to the 17 from the 14 & love it,2025-12-24
I was thinking about upgrading my iPhone 13 Pro to the 17 base model but I am thinking about just waiting 1 more year for the 18 version and upgrading then.,2025-12-24
Clearly explained the only ones required. Thanks :),2025-12-24
"11:40, while the storage argument is valid if you only buy new, people should seriously consider buying used for big local storage upgrades.

Also, definitely worth considering getting an old mac mini or macbook and just using it as a backup computer with phone data and photo backups. like a $100 2015 macbook pro with 256-512gb of fast storage to offload pics, instead of paying $100 extra to go from a used base 15 Pro Max to a 1TB 15 pro max, for instance.

Also, worth considering getting a used 15 pro or pro max instead of the 17. But i get it if you just prefer new. Just imo, I'd rather have the pro phone, 3 cameras, all for $200-300 less.",2025-12-24
"Coming from the base 15 to the 17 pro, there’s a notable upgrade. So I would say even 2 years you’re going to get a decent upgrade",2025-12-24

"I upgraded from XS Max to iPhone 17. 3 weeks of using it. 
I don't know if getting 16 Pro is way better or iPhone 17. They're basically the same price here in my country in 256gb with low cc count
Any thoughts if 16 pro is better? I like Portrait mode",2025-12-24

People with ADHD would notice and love it,2025-12-24
"interesting comparison, thanks. just a small thing, but if you pay for applecare for your phone, it's worth getting the battery replaced when it has seriously degraded. costs nothing and is an easy way to utilise all those monthly direct debit payments for the policy. i did it with my 13 mini and it totally gave the phone a new lease of life for an extra ~1.5 years. i think in most people's phone life-cycle, that's a respectable extension!",2025-12-24
I got the XR to broke for another phone,2025-12-24
