"Good summary. 13 mini user here. I'm still happy, or at least I was until Apple forced iOS 26 on me. We'll see how that goes. I charge it on a magsafe stand overnight or magsafe in the car, so 15W / lightning really aren't a huge deal, it lasts me well enough. I use an iPad for a lot of things, so the phone doesn't get used a ton, certainly not doom scrolling. I have a small magsafe battery from baseus which can fully charge it in a pinch, and that's in my bag just in case, but I've only needed it once. I really don't care about Apple Intelligence today, maybe if that gets better, but I'm not holding my breath. I'd like better cameras, and a better display wouldn't hurt. Useful Siri would probably clinch the deal. But I love the mini form factor, I'm really not looking forward to carrying a bigger/heavier phone.

For the reference I have base 11 and I still think those cameras hold up but zoom and night time photos just suck.

"11:40, while the storage argument is valid if you only buy new, people should seriously consider buying used for big local storage upgrades.
